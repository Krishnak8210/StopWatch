StopWatch project
            A stopwatch is a timekeeping device designed to measure the amount of time that has elapsed between its activation and deactivation.
            Modern stopwatches often come with various features to enhance their functionality. Here are some common stopwatch features:

Start/Stop Button: The basic function of a stopwatch is to start and stop the timing. This is usually done with a button on the device.

Lap/Split Time: Many stopwatches allow you to record intermediate times while the main stopwatch continues running. The lap time is the time elapsed since the last lap, while the split time is the total elapsed time.

Reset Button: This button is used to reset the stopwatch to zero after you have recorded the elapsed time.

Countdown Timer: Some stopwatches come with a countdown timer feature, allowing you to set a specific time, and the stopwatch will count down to zero.
